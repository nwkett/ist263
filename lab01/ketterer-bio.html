    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Nicolas Ketterer, and I am an Information Management and Technology student interested in examining statistics related to sports, the environment and politics. Some of my skills include communication, team player, leadership and intelligence. Outside of school, I love socializing with my friends, playing golf, cooking and surfing. My favorite TV shows are peaky blinders, game of thrones and better call saul. An interesting fun fact about me is I live in Nantucket Massachusetts over the summer and shuck oysters at the local Cisco Brewery and host private raw bar and catering events.
