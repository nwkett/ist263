        <h2>Personal Information </h2>

        <p>
            Outside of school, I love socializing with my friends, playing golf, cooking and surfing. 
            My favorite TV shows are peaky blinders, game of thrones and better call saul. An interesting fun fact about me is 
            I live in Nantucket Massachusetts over the summer and shuck oysters at the local Cisco Brewery and host private raw bar 
            and catering events.
