                    <h2>What is Remote Work?</h2>
                    <p>Remote work, often referred to as working from home or flexible work, allows individuals to perform their job tasks outside of an office environment. This can range from working from home to digital nomadism, where professionals travel while maintaining their careers.</p>

                    <h2>How Did Remote Work Start?</h2>
                    <p>The concept of remote work began to gain traction in the late 1970s with advancements in technology. The rise of the internet, email, and collaborative tools paved the way for companies to embrace flexible work arrangements. 
                        The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated remote work, leading to a widespread increase in remote work opportunities. Recently, “companies have implemented new policies on remote and hybrid work, and 53% of U.S. survey respondents say they plan to continue working from home at least part-time.” (Wrike)</p>
